# cpp-utf8-io
Read and Write UTF-8 encoded characters to a text file *in Windows*

UTF-8 I/O works out of the box in many Linux distros, but presents problems in Windows systems, due to different locales.

This is a simple solution that works in Windows, tested on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition
